##The Function will calculate the inverse of the matrix. However, if the inverse has already been calculated, 
##the function will retrieve the previously calculated inverse.

## makeCacheMatrix will store the previously input matrix and its respective inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) { ##Creating a function called makeCacheMatrix which will have input as x(matrix)

        x<<-y                               ##Set function will allow the input value (y) to be passed to x - i.e. change our matrix
        i<<-NULL                            ##Since we are changing the input matrix, we would want i to be null again in case it is storing an inverse of previous matrix
